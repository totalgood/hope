## Title

There's Hope for Chatbots

## Description

Studies have shown that "laisez faire" social networks, like Twitter, Facebook, video game "side-channels", and even Slack subtly nudge us all into gradually becoming more narcissistic and unkind. But there's Hope. A good moderator ans some simple "Karma" can turn anti-social networks pro (pro-social). At Hopester we've built a simple open source chatbot called Hope. We'll show you how it works.

## Pitch

Open source python packages for Natural Language Processing can now detect sarcasm and bullying with greater than 70% accuracy.[1] A variety of python chatbot engines and API wrappers make it possible to build hopeful, helpful chatbots that can help us all become more sensitive chatters. Hope is a chatbot contributing helpful nudges in chat forums and communities to minimize bullying and create a more fun, inclusive world for us all. 

## Bio

I zig when others zag. After 12 years as an aerospace engineer, and living the dream sailing around the world for 4 years, I found my purpose in Portland's Open Source community. The openness of early MOOCs made it possible for me to retrain myself as a Machine Learning developer, and I've been repaying that debt ever since. I cofounded TotalGood where we support nonprofits doing data science that adds to the commpon good.
